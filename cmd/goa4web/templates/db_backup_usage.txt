Usage:
  {{.Prog}} db backup [flags]

The db backup command creates a backup of the database and saves it to a SQL
file. This can be used to create snapshots of the database for disaster recovery
or for migrating the database to a new server.

The backup is created using the database driver's native backup tools, so the
resulting file will be in a format that is compatible with the original database
engine.

Before running this command, ensure that the database connection string is
correctly configured in your configuration file or environment variables.

Examples:
  # Create a backup of the database and save it to "backup.sql"
  {{.Prog}} db backup -file backup.sql

{{template "flag_groups_section" .FlagGroups}}
