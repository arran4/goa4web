Usage:
  {{.Prog}} db create

The db create command initializes a new database by creating the necessary
tables and schema. This command is intended to be run once when setting up a new
installation. It does not apply any seed data; for that, use the "db seed"
or "db setup" command.

Before running this command, ensure that the database connection string is
correctly configured in your configuration file or environment variables.

Examples:
  # Create the database schema
  {{.Prog}} db create

{{- range .FlagGroups}}
{{.Title}}
{{- range .Flags}}
    -{{.Name}} {{.DefValue}}
        {{.Usage}}
{{- end}}
{{end}}
