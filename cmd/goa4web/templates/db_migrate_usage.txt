Usage:
  {{.Prog}} db migrate [flags]

The db migrate command applies all pending database migrations to bring the
schema up to date. Migrations are SQL files that contain incremental changes to
the database schema, allowing for version control and controlled updates.

By default, this command uses the embedded migration files that are compiled
into the application. However, you can specify a custom directory of migration
files using the -dir flag.

Before running this command, ensure that the database connection string is
correctly configured in your configuration file or environment variables.

Examples:
  # Apply all pending migrations from the embedded collection
  {{.Prog}} db migrate

  # Apply migrations from a custom directory
  {{.Prog}} db migrate -dir /path/to/migrations

{{template "flag_groups_section" .FlagGroups}}
