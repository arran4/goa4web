Usage:
  {{.Prog}} db restore [flags]

The db restore command restores the database from a SQL file that was created
with the "db backup" command. This is useful for recovering from data loss or
for migrating the database to a new server.

The restore process will overwrite the existing database, so be sure to have a
backup of the current database before running this command.

Before running this command, ensure that the database connection string is
correctly configured in your configuration file or environment variables.

Examples:
  # Restore the database from "backup.sql"
  {{.Prog}} db restore -file backup.sql

{{template "flag_groups_section" .FlagGroups}}
