Usage:
  {{.Prog}} db seed

The db seed command populates the database with initial data, such as default
roles, permissions, and other essential records. This command is typically run
after creating the database schema with "db create" or as part of the "db setup"
command.

Before running this command, ensure that the database connection string is
correctly configured in your configuration file or environment variables.

Examples:
  # Seed the database with initial data
  {{.Prog}} db seed

{{- range .FlagGroups}}
{{.Title}}
{{- range .Flags}}
    -{{.Name}} {{.DefValue}}
        {{.Usage}}
{{- end}}
{{end}}
