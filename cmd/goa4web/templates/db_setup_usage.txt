Usage:
  {{.Prog}} db setup

The db setup command is a convenient shortcut for initializing a new database.
It performs the following actions in order:

1. Creates the database schema (equivalent to "db create")
2. Applies seed data to populate the database with initial records (equivalent
   to "db seed")

This command is ideal for setting up a fresh installation of the application.

Before running this command, ensure that the database connection string is
correctly configured in your configuration file or environment variables.

Examples:
  # Create the database schema and apply seed data
  {{.Prog}} db setup

{{- range .FlagGroups}}
{{.Title}}
{{- range .Flags}}
    -{{.Name}} {{.DefValue}}
        {{.Usage}}
{{- end}}
{{end}}
