Usage:
  {{.Prog}} role <command> [<args>]

that can be assigned to users. Roles simplify permission management by allowing
you to group related permissions together and assign them to users as a single
unit.

Commands:
  add     Add a new role to the system.
  delete  Delete an existing role.
  list    List all available roles.
  update  Update the permissions associated with a role.
  users   List all users assigned to each role.

Examples:
  # Add a new role named "editor"
  {{.Prog}} role add -name editor

  # Delete the "editor" role
  {{.Prog}} role delete -name editor

  # List all roles
  {{.Prog}} role list

  # Update the "editor" role
  {{.Prog}} role update -name editor -add-perm "blog:write"

  # List all users with the "editor" role
  {{.Prog}} role users -name editor
