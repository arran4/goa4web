Usage:
  {{.Prog}} serve [flags]

The serve command starts the web server, making the application accessible to
users. This is the primary command for running the application and is
responsible for initializing all the necessary components, such as the database,
session management, and routing.

The server can be configured using a combination of command-line flags, a
configuration file, and environment variables. The configuration is resolved in
the following order of precedence:

1. Command-line flags
2. Configuration file
3. Environment variables

This allows you to override the default settings with more specific values
without modifying the main configuration file.

Examples:
  # Start the server with the default settings
  {{.Prog}} serve

  # Start the server on a specific port
  {{.Prog}} serve -http-listen-addr :8080

  # Use a custom configuration file
  {{.Prog}} -config /path/to/config.yaml serve

  # Enable verbose logging
  {{.Prog}} serve -verbosity 2
