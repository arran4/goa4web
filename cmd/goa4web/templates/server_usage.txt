Usage:
  {{.Prog}} server <command> [<args>]

The server command is used to manage the running application server. You can
gracefully shut down the server and check its status. This is the primary
interface for interacting with the live server process.

Commands:
  shutdown  Gracefully stop the running server, with options for specifying a
            timeout and shutdown mode.
  stats     Print server runtime statistics in table or JSON format.

Examples:
  # Gracefully shut down the server with a 5-second timeout
  {{.Prog}} server shutdown --timeout 5s

  # Shut down only the REST API component of the server
  {{.Prog}} server shutdown --mode rest

  # Print server statistics as JSON
  {{.Prog}} server stats --format json
