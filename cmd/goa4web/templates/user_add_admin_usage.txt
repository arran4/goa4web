Usage:
  {{.Prog}} user add-admin [flags]

The user add-admin command is a convenient shortcut for creating a new user with
administrator rights. It is equivalent to running "user add" with the -admin
flag.

You can specify the username, email address, and password using flags. If the
password is not provided, you will be prompted to enter it securely.

Examples:
  # Create a new administrator named "admin" with the password "secret"
  {{.Prog}} user add-admin -username admin -password secret

  # Create a new administrator with an email address
  {{.Prog}} user add-admin -username alice -email "alice@example.com"
