Usage:
  {{.Prog}} user add-role [flags]

The user add-role command grants a specific role to a user. Roles are used to
assign a pre-defined set of permissions, making it easy to manage access control
for large numbers of users.

You must specify the user by their username and the role by either its name or
ID.

Examples:
  # Grant the "editor" role to the user "bob"
  {{.Prog}} user add-role -username bob -role editor

  # Grant the role with ID 3 to the user "alice"
  {{.Prog}} user add-role -username alice -role-id 3
