Usage:
  {{.Prog}} user add [flags]

The user add command creates a new user account. You can specify the username,
email address, and password using flags. If the password is not provided, you
will be prompted to enter it securely.

By default, the new user will be assigned the "user" role. You can grant
administrator rights by using the -admin flag.

Examples:
  # Create a new user named "bob" with the password "secret"
  {{.Prog}} user add -username bob -password secret

  # Create a new user with an email address
  {{.Prog}} user add -username alice -email "alice@example.com"

  # Create a new administrator user
  {{.Prog}} user add -username admin -password "supersecret" -admin
