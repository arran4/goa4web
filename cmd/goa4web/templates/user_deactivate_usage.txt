Usage:
  {{.Prog}} user deactivate [flags]

The user deactivate command deactivates a user's account, preventing them from
logging in. This command also scrubs the user's personal information from the
database, replacing it with random data. This is a destructive operation and
should be used with caution.

You must specify the user to be deactivated by their username.

Examples:
  # Deactivate the user "bob"
  {{.Prog}} user deactivate -username bob

{{template "flag_groups_section" .FlagGroups}}
