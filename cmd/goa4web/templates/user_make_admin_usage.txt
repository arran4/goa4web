Usage:
  {{.Prog}} user make-admin [flags] <username>

The user make-admin command grants administrator rights to an existing user.
This is useful for promoting a regular user to an administrator without having
to create a new account.

The user to be promoted can be specified either with the -username flag or as an
argument to the command.

Examples:
  # Grant administrator rights to the user "bob"
  {{.Prog}} user make-admin bob

  # Grant administrator rights to the user "alice" using the -username flag
  {{.Prog}} user make-admin -username alice
