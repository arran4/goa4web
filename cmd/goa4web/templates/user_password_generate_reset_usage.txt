{{.Command}} user password generate-reset [--username USERNAME | --user-id USER_ID]

Generates a password reset link for a user.

This command is intended for administrative use when a user is unable to reset their password through the standard web interface (e.g., they do not have a verified email address).

It generates a secure, single-use password reset link and a temporary password. The administrator must provide both of these to the user. The user will be required to enter the temporary password to set their new password.

At least one of --username or --user-id must be provided.
