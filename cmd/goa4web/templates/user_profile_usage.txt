Usage:
  {{.Prog}} user profile [flags]

The user profile command displays detailed information about a user, including
their ID, username, email addresses, and any administrative comments.

You must specify the user by either their ID or username. You can also specify
a viewer user ID to see the profile as that user would see it.

Examples:
  # Show the profile for the user with ID 3
  {{.Prog}} user profile -id 3

  # Show the profile for the user "bob"
  {{.Prog}} user profile -username bob

  # Show the profile for the user "bob" as seen by the user with ID 4
  {{.Prog}} user profile -username bob -user 4
