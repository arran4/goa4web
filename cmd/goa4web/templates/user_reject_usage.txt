Usage:
  {{.Prog}} user reject [flags]

The user reject command rejects a pending user account. This command will assign
the "rejected" role to the user, which will prevent them from logging in. You
can also provide an optional reason for the rejection, which will be stored as an
administrative comment.

You must specify the user to be rejected by either their ID or username.

Examples:
  # Reject the user with ID 3
  {{.Prog}} user reject -id 3

  # Reject the user "bob" with a reason
  {{.Prog}} user reject -username bob -reason "Spam account"
