Usage:
  {{.Prog}} user remove-role [flags]

The user remove-role command revokes a specific role from a user, removing the
associated permissions. This is the counterpart to the "user add-role" command.

You must specify the user by their username and the role by its name.

Examples:
  # Revoke the "editor" role from the user "bob"
  {{.Prog}} user remove-role -username bob -role editor

{{template "flag_groups_section" .FlagGroups}}
