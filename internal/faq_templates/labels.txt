How do labels work?
===
Labels are tags that can be attached to content (like forum threads, blog posts, etc.) to help organize and filter them. There are three types of labels:

[b Public Labels]
These are labels visible to everyone. In the forum, they are typically managed by administrators and moderators. Examples include "Pinned" or "Announcement".

[b Author Labels]
These are labels set by the author of the content. They allow the author to categorize their own posts. For example, a blog post author might add tags like "Tech" or "Personal".

[b Private Labels]
These are labels that are only visible to you. You can use them to organize content for your own reference.
Some private labels are automatically managed by the system, such as:
- [b new]: Indicates content you haven't seen yet.
- [b unread]: Indicates content that has been updated since you last viewed it.

You can also add your own private labels to threads or posts to bookmark them or categorize them in a way that makes sense to you.

[b Managing Labels]
You can typically manage labels from the sidebar or the bottom of the content page. Look for a "Labels" section where you can add or remove your private labels.
